# Server polling history dialog

The Server poling history dialog lists recent polls for a server.

You reach this dialog from the [main window / Server Sets tab](gui_main_sstab.md) by selecting a server set in the left list, expand the details for a server (right pane of content area), and clicking the "Polling history..." button.

Note: In the [Options dialog / Server polling section](gui_opt_serverpolling.md), you can configure Simple Failover to "Only record poll result when server status changes", and "purge entries older than \_\_\_ days" which reduces the number of events listed here.
