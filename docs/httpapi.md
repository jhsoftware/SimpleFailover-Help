# HTTP API

Nearly all the functions found in the Simple Failover UI are also available through a REST based HTTP API.

The HTTP API is enabled and configured in the [Options dialog / HTTP API section](gui_opt_httpapi.md).

The HTTP API URLs which return or accept data do so in JSON format.

In order to learn the data format for POST / PUT methods, copy/examine the data returned by the corresponding GET methods.

The following table describes the available URLs and HTTP methods available with the HTTP API:

|**URL**|**HTTP Method**|**Description**|**Remarks**
|---|---|---|---|
|/log|GET|Fetch the latest log lines|The number of log lines cached is configured in the Options dialog / Logging section|
|/options|GET|Fetch current program options||
|/options|PUT|Update program options|Request body must include complete program options in JSON format|
|/pauseall|POST|Pauses all server polling|Same as checking "Pause all polling" button in GUI
|/pollall|POST|Polls all server sets immediately|Same as clicking "Poll all server sets" button in GUI|
