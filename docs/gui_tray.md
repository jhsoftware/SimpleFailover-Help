# Tray Icon

The Simple Failover user interface (sfogui.exe) is represented by an icon in the system tray of your Windows desktop area.

This provides several useful features as follows:

- Double-clicking on the icon will open the [main window](gui_main.md).

- You can access a pop-up menu by right-clicking on the icon:

    From this menu, you can either open Simple Failover (opens the [main window](gui_main.md)), Pause / Resume all server polling, or exit the Simple Failover UI (leaves the service running in the background).


- When all polling is paused, this will be indicated by a red pause symbol flashing on the tray icon:

- The tray icon can also show balloon tips to let you know that problems were detected - when enabled in the [Options dialog / User interface section](gui_opt_ui.md).
