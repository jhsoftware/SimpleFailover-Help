Each server set in the list (left) also has an icon indicating the current overall status of the server set: green / check mark = all ok, red / cross = one or more problems, grey / ? = unknown status.

The status page (right) displays detailed status information for individual servers and for individual DNS servers / host names.

Click the white circle with the arrow down to "open" further details for each item.
