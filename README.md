## Repository structure

- Topic files (markdown) are stored in the `docs` folder.\
The name of each topic file is: `<page-ID>.md`.
- A `_TOC.md` file (in the `docs` folder) contains title of the help file and the table of content, and must follow strict formatting (see below).
- A `chm-template` folder (in the repository root) contains files specific to CHM help file generation.

### Page IDs

Page IDs (in topic file names) are used to link the help buttons in the software to the help file.

### The '_TOC.md' file

Must follow this format - sub-topics indented exactly a multiple of 4 spaces:

```
---
<key>: <value>
<key>: <value>
---
# <Help file title>

- [<Topic title>](<page-id>.md)
- <Title of folder with no page>
    - [<Topic title>](<page-id>.md)
    - [<Topic title>](<page-id>.md)
- [<Title of folder with page>](<page-id>.md)
    - [<Topic title>](<page-id>.md)
    - [<Topic title>](<page-id>.md)
```

### Topic content files

Must follow this format:

```
---
<key>: <value>
<key>: <value>
---
# <Page title>

<Markdown content>
```

### Front-matter

At the top of each file is a section with meta data. This section starts and ends with with three dashes (---) on a line by itself.
In other similar documentation projects, this section is in YAML format.
That is also the plan for this project, but it we haven't gotten to that just yet.
For now it is just a line based collection of properties - one property per line.
Each line consisting of a key value pair.

For the '_TOC.md' file, there are 3 required properties:

- **ProductName:** Name of the product that this help file is for.
- **ProductVersion:** Version of the product that this help file is for.
- **DefaultTopic:** The file name of the default topic page.

For topic files, there is one required property:

- **Slug:** The last part of the URL of the web version of this topic page. Must be unique.
 
And topic files may have one of more of these optional properties:  

- **Keywords:** A comma separated list of keywords.
- **Contributors:** Comma separated list of GitHub IDs of contributors  
- **Notes:** Notes / remarks.


### Document title

After the front-matter section, there must be exactly one H1 header (#) with the title of the document.

### Special HTML rendering (callouts)

We use blockquotes (lines starting with ">") for special HTML rendering.

If you place one of the following tags following the first ">", the whole blockquote will be rendered as follows:

| Tag        | Blockquote rendering |
| ---------- | --- |
| `[!BLUE]`  | Light blue callout. For information without any special emphasis.| 
| `[!GREEN]` | Green callout. For special tips and tricks or other helpful knowledge. | 
| `[!YELLOW]`| Yellow callout. For stuff that requires cautions.  |
| `[!RED]`   | Red callout. Warn readers about situations that could cause data loss or unexpected consequences. |

For example:

```
> [!GREEN] Wash the car every sunday for best appearances
```

### Conditional rendering

The tags `[?CHM]`, `[?WEB]`, and `[?ANY]` control where the content following each tag is rendered.

Content that follows `[?CHM]` is rendered in off-line help file (.chm) file only.

Content that follows `[?WEB]` is rendered in the on-line version only.

Content that follows `[?ANY]` is always rendered.

The default is `[?ANY]`.

### Links

Bare URLs are NOT automatically converted into links.

Bookmarks must be specified like this: `{#bookmark}`

## The 'chm-template' folder

Contains a `page.html` file which is the template for generating pages in the resulting CHM file.

Other files in this folder are image and CSS files used by the template.

The template file may contain one or more of these replacement tags:

`{YEAR}` - Current year (at the time of compilation)\
`{TIME}` - Date and time (at the time of compilation)\
`{PRODUCTNAME}` - Product name (from front matter in _TOC.md file)\
`{PRODUCTVERSION}` - Product versionD (from front matter in _TOC.md file)\
`{BOOKTITLE}` - Help file title - HTML encoded (from # in _TOC.md file)\
`{PAGEID}` - Page ID\
`{PAGETITLE}` - Page title - HTML encoded\
`{TOCPAGETITLE}` - TOC page title - HTML encoded\
`{BREADCRUMBS}` - Bread crumbs HTML\
`{CONTENT}` - Page content
